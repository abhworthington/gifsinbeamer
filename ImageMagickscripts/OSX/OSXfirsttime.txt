To get set up for OSX use, you have to install the ImageMagick package. Here's how to do that. Line breaks matter here, but it seemed the easiest way to convey all of this.

If you are using OSX and you don't have ImageMagick installed, here's a relatively-simple way to do it. The first set of steps are if you have neither Homebrew nor ImageMagick. If you have either (or both), scroll down a bit.

First, open Terminal.
Then, copy/paste and execute the following line of code:

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

This will install "Homebrew" - a program which simplifies installation and management of homebrew/commandline/unix packages in OSX.

Second, with Homebrew installed and the Terminal still open, copy/paste and execute this line of code:

brew install imagemagick

(Now, scroll to the bottom)

If you already have Homebrew but not Imagemagick, I recommend making sure you're up to date by running the following line of code in Terminal:

brew update && brew upgrade

(Only if you've already got Homebrew!)

Now, just run the following line of code in Terminal:

brew install imagemagick
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

If you have Imagemagick and Homebrew, just update 

brew reinstall imagemagick

(It may give you some lip, just copy and execute whatever it asks you to.)

Once you've installed ImageMagick:
1) Save the giftopng.command file to the Desktop. (This is just for the first step. You can relocate it anywhere after this.)
2) Open a Terminal (if not already open).
3) Execute the following command:

chmod +x ~/Desktop/giftopng.command

4) Once you have executed the code above, you can move the command file wherever you like, including into a special folder for processing GIFs.
5) Clicking on the giftopng.command file will open a Terminal, create a subfolder, and convert any GIF in that folder to PNGs which are placed in the subfolder. (If you get an "unidentified developer" error, rightclick the file and Open With... Terminal. You should only need to do this once. This is a security and privacy issue with OSX.)
